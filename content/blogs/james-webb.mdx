The **James Webb Space Telescope** (JWST) is humanity’s most advanced telescope, designed to explore the universe in **infrared** light. Launched in 2021, it orbits 1.5 million km from Earth at the **L2 point**, far beyond the Moon.

With a massive **6.5m gold-coated mirror**, it captures light from the first galaxies formed after the Big Bang—over 13 billion years ago. Unlike Hubble, which sees mostly visible and UV light, Webb peers through **cosmic dust**, revealing the birth of stars and analyzing atmospheres of distant exoplanets for signs of life.

Its first images shocked the world: **galaxies, nebulae, and ancient light** all in stunning detail. JWST is more than a telescope—it’s a **time machine** and a symbol of human curiosity.

We’re not just looking up—we’re **looking back**, trying to answer the biggest question: *Where did we come from?*
